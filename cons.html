                      <hr>
                       <p class="lead"> BSFB is a true franchise building experience designed to mimic the NBA as closely as fantasy sports will allow.</p>
                       <p>Scoring System is Head-to-Head Total Points: Teams compete Head to Head to earn a single <strong> Win, Loss or Tie </strong> based on which team scores more Fantasy Points in a scoring period.
                       All 30 NBA Franchises will be represented. Full 82 Game Schedule for 12 teams with 8 making the playoffs. Realistic year round off-season activity.</p>

                       <p> Our League began circa 2007-08 in the droms of Arizona State in Tempe. (The same building that future NBA All-Star James Harden was living). This October we will be entering our 8th season as a league. Below is our "League Constitution", where all league rules and detailes will be housed.  </p>
                       <p> Any perspective manager interested in joining please message a comissioner <a href="#">here</a>. </p>
